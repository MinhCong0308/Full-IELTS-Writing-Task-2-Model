      "Essay: It is argued that the authorities should invest more money in the public transport system. I completely agree with this statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the one hand, there are a number of reasons why governments should invest money in public transport systems. The first reason is that public transport can improve peopleâ€™s quality of life. For example, people can use public transportation such as buses or subways to commute from home to work or from work to city centre. In addition, public transport can also reduce traffic congestion. This is because public transport can increase the number of vehicles on the road and reduce the number of cars on the street.\n",
      " \n",
      "Another point to consider is that public transportation can have a huge impact on the economy of the country. In other words, people can buy public transportation like cars or motorbikes for their daily needs. As a result, the quality of the public transportation can be improved. For instance, people can travel to work or study without having to take public transportation to work. Furthermore, public transportation can improve the safety of citizens. It is well-known that people are more likely to commit crimes if they are not wearing helmets. \n",
      " \n",
      "In conclusion, there are some benefits of investing more money in public transportation systems. However, I think that governments should focus on public transport systems to improve the quality of life for their citizens. In the future, more money should be spent on improving public transport systems rather than investing in private vehicles. Also, governments should invest in improving the economy of their countries.\n",

      "Essay: In this day and age, peer pressure is considered as one of the most important factors affecting young people's behaviour. However, in this essay, I will discuss both advantages and disadvantages of this phenomenon.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the one hand, there are several drawbacks of peer pressure. To begin with, peer pressure can have a negative impact on young people. For example, if young people are affected by peer pressure, they may not be able to concentrate on their studies. As a result, they may be distracted from their studies. Moreover, young people may be influenced by other people whom they do not know. For instance, young people who are not well-prepared can be affected by other people who do not know them. Consequently, young people might be influenced by others who do not have enough knowledge.\n",
      "However, I believe that the advantages of peer pressure are more significant than the disadvantages. The first advantage is that peer pressure can improve young people's self-esteem. This is because peer pressure can increase the confidence of young people. Furthermore, young people can learn how to deal with peer pressure. As a consequence, young people will be able to cope with their peer pressure. \n",
      "In conclusion, although there are some disadvantages for peer pressure, I think that the benefits of this phenomenon outweigh the disadvantages. It is recommended that young people should be encouraged to learn how to handle peer pressure. In addition, young people should focus on their studies in order to avoid being influenced by other young people. This will help them to reduce their peer pressure and improve their self-esteem in the long run.\n",

      "There are several reasons why young people are affected by peer pressure. Firstly, young people tend to be influenced by external factors such as peer groups and social media. For example, when young people are exposed to inappropriate content on social media, they tend to share it with their friends and family members. As a result, this leads to peer pressure among young people. Secondly, young people are more likely to be victims of peer violence. For instance, young people who are abused or neglected by their parents, teachers or peers may have a higher chance of being killed by their peers than young people who were not abused or neglected. This leads to the fact that young people who have been abused or neglected are at higher risk of being victims of peer pressure than those who are not abused or neglected.\n",
      "On the other hand, there are some benefits of peer pressure. The first benefit is that young people can improve their communication skills. This is because young people learn how to communicate with their peers and get to know each other easily. Furthermore, young people can develop a sense of belonging to their peers. This means that when young people feel like they belong to their peers, they will be more likely to share ideas with them and make suggestions to solve problems in their life.

For example, if young people do not get enough support from their parents or teachers, they might not be able to cope up with their peers. Secondly, peer pressure can be a source of stress for young people. For instance, when young people are exposed to peer pressure, they may feel stressed because they do not have enough time to focus on their studies. Finally, young people may be influenced by peer pressure more than other factors. To illustrate this point, a recent study conducted by the University of Columbia shows that peer pressure has a negative effect on students' behaviour.\n",

This is because young people may lack the ability to handle peer pressure. Another disadvantage is that peer pressure may affect young people's social skills.

As a result, this leads to a sense of inferiorityesteem among young people. Secondly, peer pressure can have a negative impact on the behaviour of young people.

Secondly, young people are more likely to be influenced by other people's behaviours.
