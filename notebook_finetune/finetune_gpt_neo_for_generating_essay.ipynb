      "On the one hand, it is true that the government should invest a large amount of money in the public transport system. The main reason for this is that the number of people who use public transport is increasing day by day. In other words, people are more likely to travel to their destinations in the morning and evening. For example, in the United States of America, there are more than 70,000 people using public transport every day. Therefore, the authorities have to invest a huge amount of funds in the system to improve people’s life.    On the other hand, the government has to spend a lot of money on the infrastructure of the system. To be more specific, the authority has to invest in the development of the public transportation system. For instance, in Vietnam, there is a large number of public transport systems, such as trains, buses, and subways, which have been developed by the government.  Therefore, it would be more beneficial for the government to invest more money in these systems. \n",

      "\r\n",
      "To begin with, globalization has made our lives easier and more comfortable. It is easy to travel around the world and meet people from all over the world. For example, we can travel to the United States of America, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. We can also travel to other parts of the world, such as Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. In addition, globalisation has also made our life more convenient and comfortable. For instance, people can go to work, go to school, or go to the doctor's office anytime they want. Globalization also makes our lives more comfortable and more convenient. \r\n",
      "    On the other hand, globalization has also affected our lives in a negative way. It has led to a lot of problems such as poverty, unemployment, and crime. These problems have led to the increase in the number of people who are unable to afford their own accommodation or food. As a result, many people have been forced to migrate to other countries, which has resulted in the loss of their homes, their families, and their livelihoods. Globalisation also has made the lives of many people more stressful and more difficult.  For example: If a person is unable to find a job, he or she will have to leave his or her family and go back to their hometowns. This situation has also led to an increase in crime rates in many countries, especially in the developing countries.  In addition to this, globalization also has had a negative impact on the economy of many countries. The increase in unemployment and poverty has also resulted in a decrease in the quality of life for many people in those countries. This is why the government should focus more on the development of the economy and the country itself.  \n",

      "\r\n",
      "On the one hand, there are several reasons why some people believe that a diploma or degree is not free. First of all, it is not compulsory for all students to get a diploma. For example, if a student does not have a master's degree, he or she will not be able to get admission to the university. In addition, many students do not have enough time to complete their studies. For instance, a student who is not able to complete his or her studies may not have sufficient time to study at university. As a result, some students may not be interested in going to university. \r\n",
      "    On the other hand, I believe that students have the right to choose their own degree. To begin with, a degree is an academic subject that is taught in a school. In other words, a diploma is a certificate that is given to a person who has a degree in a particular field. In this way, students can choose to study in a university or college without paying a tuition fee.

      "On the one hand, there are several reasons why people think this is a problem. First of all, people who live in a wealthy country tend to earn more money than those who are in a poor country. This is because they have more money to spend, and they have a higher standard of living. As a result, they are able to afford their own houses, cars, and food. Moreover, they can earn a lot of money in their free time.

      "On another hand, some people believe that this situation is not a problem because the gap is wider. They think that there are many ways to solve this problem. One of the most common ways is to use social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. These platforms allow people to connect with their friends and family members, and to find out more about them.

For example, if a child is taught that he or she should respect others and show respect to others, then it will be easier for them to understand the value of respecting others. Therefore, it is important for schools to teach children how to respect others, such as respecting others’ words and actions.    On the other hand, others think that children need to be taught how to be respectful to others. To begin with, children should learn how to treat others. For instance, if they are taught that they should treat others with respect and kindness, then children will be less likely to show disrespect towards others.  Therefore, schools should be more focused on children's moral values, rather than their parents' values. \r\n",

In the future, I would like to encourage parents to be more respectful to their children.  They should also be more aware of their own value.

If schools are successful in teaching moral values to children, it will help them to become a better person in the future.  I believe this is the best way to ensure that children have good moral values in their future lives.

      "To begin with, there are many reasons why some people believe that the press should not publish the personal life of politicians. First of all, the press is the main source of information for the government. In other words, the government is responsible for providing the information to the public. For example, in the United States, the media is the primary source of news for the administration. Therefore, the public should be informed of the current state of the economy, politics, and the economy of the country. Secondly, the newspaper is a source of entertainment for the general public. It is the most convenient way for the public to get information about the current affairs. For instance, in India, the entertainment industry is a major source of income for the people of India. Hence, it should be the main focus of the government in order to keep the public informed about the economy and politics of the nation. \r\n",
      "    On the other hand, some people argue that the government should not allow the press to be censored. First and foremost, the freedom of press is a fundamental right of every citizen of the state. For Instance, the right to freedom of speech is enshrined in the constitution of the United Kingdom. Furthermore, freedom of expression is a right of everyone, regardless of religion, gender, nationality, or political status. For Example, in Canada, the Canadian government has freedom of the expression of their citizens in the press, which is considered to be the most effective way to protect the privacy of the press.   In addition, the news media should be free to publish the news in the newspaper. This is because it is the best way to provide the public with the information they need to make informed decisions about their lives.  Therefore, it would be better if the press were allowed to be freedom of information. \n",

Second, international tourism can be a great source of income for local businesses and individuals, which can be used to improve the quality of life of local people.

For this reason, it can be argued that international tourism is not a good choice for people who want to travel to their destinations.  Second, it may have negative effects on the tourism industry, which is a waste of money and time. If a business or an individual wants to visit a country, they will have to pay a huge amount of money for it, which means that they will not have enough time to spend with their families and friends.

For example, a person who works for a company that does not have a high level of competition in terms of employees, may not be able to compete with other employees.

For instance, people who work for long hours have a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases than those who do not work. \r\n",
      "    On the other hand, I would argue that working for a long time can be beneficial for both employees and the company. First and foremost, it can help to improve the productivity of a company. To be more specific, a company can improve its employees’ work efficiency by increasing the amount of time that employees spend on their work. In other words, if employees spend more time on their jobs, they will have more time to do their work more efficiently. Furthermore, it will help the company to increase the profit margin of the business. To illustrate, if a company has more employees, the company’s profit margin will be increased.  In addition, it also helps to reduce the cost of living in a country. To exemplify, people living in the United States have less money than people who live in the other country.  Therefore, people can save more money by saving less money in their living expenses. \n",
